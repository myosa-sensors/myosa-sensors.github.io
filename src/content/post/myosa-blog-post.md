## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank the contributors of the [MyOSA GitHub repository](https://github.com/myosa-sensors) and the team at [www.myosa-sensors.org](http://www.myosa-sensors.org) for their documentation and support.

## Overview
The MyOSA project provides a standardized framework for sensor integration, allowing users to quickly prototype IoT solutions. It bridges the gap between raw hardware data and actionable insights through a unified sensor array.

**Key features:**
* Plug-and-play sensor compatibility.
* Real-time data streaming and visualization.
* Open-source firmware for custom modifications.
* Detailed documentation for rapid IoT learning.

## Features (Detailed)

### 1. Modular Sensor Design
The platform supports a wide array of sensors that can be swapped or added without requiring significant code changes, promoting hardware flexibility.

### 2. Integrated Dashboard
By visiting [www.myosa-sensors.org](http://www.myosa-sensors.org), users can access tools designed to visualize their sensor outputs in real-time.

## Usage Instructions
To begin collecting data, navigate to your local repository and run the setup script:

```plaintext
python myosa_init.py --start
