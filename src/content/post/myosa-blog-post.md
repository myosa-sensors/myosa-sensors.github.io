## Acknowledgements
[cite_start]Special thanks to the MyOSA community and the contributors at the official MYOSA GitHub repository for providing the framework and guidelines for this project. [cite: 88, 89]

## Overview
[cite_start]The MyOSA project is designed to help beginners learn IoT fast by providing a streamlined approach to sensor data collection. [cite: 91] [cite_start]This project solves the problem of complex hardware setup by offering a unified sensor array platform. [cite: 91]

[cite_start]**Key features:** [cite: 92]
* [cite_start]Simplified IoT data acquisition [cite: 93]
* [cite_start]Real-time monitoring via the MyOSA web interface [cite: 94]
* [cite_start]Open-source hardware compatibility [cite: 95]
* [cite_start]Low-barrier entry for students and hobbyists [cite: 96]

## [cite_start]Features (Detailed) [cite: 110]

### [cite_start]1. Rapid Prototyping [cite: 113]
[cite_start]MyOSA allows users to connect sensors and begin data streaming in minutes rather than hours, making it ideal for educational environments. [cite: 114]

### [cite_start]2. Scalable Architecture [cite: 115]
[cite_start]The system is built to scale from a single sensor node to a complex array of environmental monitoring stations. [cite: 116]

## [cite_start]Usage Instructions [cite: 120]
[cite_start]To interact with the sensors, use the following command in your terminal: [cite: 122]

```plaintext
python myosa_read_data.py --sensor all
