## Demo / Examples

### **Images**
All images must be placed in the **same folder** as your markdown file.
Use the following format for images:

<img src="/Images/your-image-name.jpg" width="800"><br/>
<i>Correct Image Format Example: Caption goes here</i>
</p>

### **Videos**
Youtube links are **NOT** allowed. Place your video in the same folder and use this format:

<video controls width="100%">
<source src="/Videos/your-video-name.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<i> Correct Video Format Example: Caption goes here</i>
